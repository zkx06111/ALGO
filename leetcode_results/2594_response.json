I will define a helper function `canRepair` that will determine whether all the cars can be repaired within a given time `T`. If it is possible to repair all the cars within `T`, then I will search for a lower value of `T`, otherwise, I will search for a higher value of `T`. The binary search will continue until the range becomes empty, and the final answer will be the lowest value of `T` for which all the cars can be repaired.\n@@@@@CODE@BEGINS@@@@@\nclass Solution:\n    def repairCars(self, ranks: List[int], cars: int) -> int:\n        # Helper function to determine if all the cars can be repaired within time T\n        def canRepair(T: int) -> bool:\n            total_cars = 0\n            for rank in ranks:\n                # Number of cars that can be repaired by this mechanic within time T\n                num_cars = int((T / rank) ** 0.5)\n                total_cars += num_cars\n                if total_cars >= cars:\n                    return True\n            return total_cars >= cars\n        \n        # Sort the mechanics by their ranks in ascending order\n        ranks.sort()\n        \n        # Initialize the binary search range\n        low, high = 0, max(ranks) * cars * cars\n        \n        # Binary search for the minimum time required to repair all the cars\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if canRepair(mid):\n                high = mid - 1\n            else:\n                low = mid + 1\n        \n        return low\n\n# Test cases\nsolution = Solution()\nprint(solution.repairCars([4, 2, 3, 1], 10)) # Output: 16\nprint(solution.repairCars([5, 1, 8], 6)) # Output: 16",
