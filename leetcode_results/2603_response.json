Currently, we are adding a fixed distance of 2 for each node that has coins in its subtree. However, this is incorrect because the distance should vary based on the number of edges needed to reach the coins.\n\nTo fix this, let's do the following:\n1. For each child node, calculate the distance needed to reach the coins in its subtree and return to the child node.\n2. Sort the distances calculated for all children nodes in descending order.\n3.
