### Mice and Cheese

There are two mice and `n` different types of cheese, each type of cheese should be eaten by exactly one mouse.

A point of the cheese with index `i` (**0-indexed**) is:

- `reward1[i]` if the first mouse eats it.
- `reward2[i]` if the second mouse eats it.

You are given a positive integer array `reward1`, a positive integer array `reward2`, and a non-negative integer `k`.

Return ***the maximum** points the mice can achieve if the first mouse eats exactly* `k` *types of cheese.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: reward1 = [1,1,3,4], reward2 = [4,4,1,1], k = 2
Output: 15
Explanation: In this example, the first mouse eats the 2nd (0-indexed) and the 3rd types of cheese, and the second mouse eats the 0th and the 1st types of cheese.
The total points are 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 15.
It can be proven that 15 is the maximum total points that the mice can achieve.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: reward1 = [1,1], reward2 = [1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, the first mouse eats the 0th (0-indexed) and 1st types of cheese, and the second mouse does not eat any cheese.
The total points are 1 + 1 = 2.
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum total points that the mice can achieve.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n == reward1.length == reward2.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= reward1[i], reward2[i] <= 1000`
- `0 <= k <= n`

**Function definition**

```
class Solution:
    def miceAndCheese(self, reward1: List[int], reward2: List[int], k: int) -> int:
