# ALGO

The official repo for the paper *ALGO: Synthesizing Algorithmic Programs with Generated Oracle Verifiers*.

## Infrastructure

We built upon the following open-source projects to automatically prompt ChatGPT code interpreter, collect problem statements from LeetCode and Codeforces, and to submit solutions to LC and CF.

 - [revChatGPT](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT)
 - [python-leetcode](https://github.com/fspv/python-leetcode)
 - [CodeforcesApiPy](https://github.com/VadVergasov/CodeforcesApiPy)
 - [codeforces-problem-scraper-api](https://github.com/kerolloz/codeforces-problem-scraper-api/tree/master)

## Prompts

The prompts and the tags we used for generating the candidate solutions, the oracles, the data generators, the data verifiers are listed in `prompts.py` as format strings.

## Results for CodeContests

The results for CodeContests are in the `codecontests` folder.

For each problem there are three files. For instance, the files for problem [1575_A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1575/A) are `1575_A_bf.py`, `1575_A_test.py` and  `1575_A_data.json`.

 - `1575_A_bf.py` contains the reference oracle for the problem, where the entry point is the function `solution`.

 - `1575_A_test.py` contains the data generator for the problem, where the entry point is the function `batch_gen_inputs`.

 - `1575_A_data.json` contains the metadata and example cases for the problem. Specifically, the problem definition is in the `prompt` field, and the example cases are listed in the `examples_separate` field.

We use the ALGO-generated test cases to sort the solutions generated by Codex (which are directly taken from the [CodeT](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeT) repo) according to the number of tests they pass. For each problem there are about ~1000 candidates. They are listed along with the number of test cases in `sorted_codecontests.json`. Note that they are sorted with up to 20 test cases only.
